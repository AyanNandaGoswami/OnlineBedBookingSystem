# Proect Title:   BookYourBed

# Project Description:  
    This is a very helpful project where users can apply for word and icu type bed for covid affected patients to any hospital online. Any user after creating their account can apply for bed for covid affected patients. After applying, the hospital authority will get a notification, if they confirm this request then one bed will be booked for this patient and the user will get a confirmation mail. This mail information will be used to admit the patient in the hospital. If the hospital authority cancels this request then the user will get a cancellation mail and the user can apply again for bed.
    Here we provide a new feature that any user can apply maximum two beds for each covid patient in two different hospitals but the bed type must be the same, then notification will be sent to both the hospitals selected by the user. If one hospital authority confirms the bed request then another request will automatically be deleted.
